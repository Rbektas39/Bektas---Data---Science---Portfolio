## 🚀 Featured Projects
# Generative AI Sustainability Index

**Course:** Generative AI  
**Tools:** Python, LLM evaluation, prompt engineering  

This project examines the environmental and sustainability implications of large language models. It proposes a framework for comparing different model types based on efficiency, scale, and sustainability considerations that are typically hidden from end users.

The project compares frontier, reasoning-oriented, and smaller open-source models to highlight tradeoffs between performance and environmental cost.

# Economic Shocks and Civil Rebellion (Agent-Based Model)

**Course:** Simulating Politics and Global Affairs  
**Tools:** NetLogo, agent-based modeling, BehaviorSpace  

This project extends Epstein’s (2002) civil violence model by introducing time-varying economic hardship through regular economic shocks. The model examines how shock magnitude and frequency influence rebellion intensity and volatility.

Using BehaviorSpace experiments, the project shows that economic instability, rather than static hardship alone, plays a key role in generating extreme rebellion events.
